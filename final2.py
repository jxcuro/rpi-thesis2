# CODE 3.0.21 - AI Metal Classifier GUI with Gated Automation
# ... (previous version history) ...
# Version: 3.0.33 - MODIFIED: Increased sensor sensitivity for detecting weakly
#                  -           magnetic materials by adjusting key thresholds.
#                  -           1. Lowered the AI's magnetic detection threshold.
#                  -           2. Lowered the responsive flush threshold for the GUI.
#                  -           3. Increased calibration samples for a more precise baseline.
# Version: 3.0.32 - IMPROVED: Implemented "Responsive Smoothing" for the magnetism
#                  -           sensor. The smoothing buffer is now flushed on
#                  -           large signal changes, providing both idle stability
#                  -           against spikes and instant responsiveness for detection.

### MODIFIED FOR SENSITIVITY ### - Parameters for Responsive Smoothing (Tunable)
# Lower thresholds make the GUI feel more responsive to weaker signals.
# 1. Greater than this absolute threshold (to ignore noise)

# 2. This many times larger than the current smoothed average
